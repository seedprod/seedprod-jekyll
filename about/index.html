<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d8b0de5a0529a729022f34f650b6fd5?s=150">Hi, I’m John Turner, founder of SeedProd. I have been a web developer for over 10 years and have been build WordPress Themes and Plugins for over 5 years. Oh yeah, and I’m addicted to the internet. There I said it :)</p>
<p>I started SeedProd with the goal in mind to provide you with 1st class quality plugins and support for WordPress. Unlike many of the free plugins in the WordPress.org repository, I wanted to create plugins&nbsp;designers, developers and users could depend on. I focus on creating plugins that are secure, reliable and up-to-date with WordPress’s constant changing API.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or just want to say hi, <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>!</p>
