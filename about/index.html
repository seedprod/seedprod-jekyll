I have been a web developer for over 10 years and have been building WordPress Themes and Plugins for over 5 years.</p>
            <p>I started SeedProd with the goal in mind to create the best Coming Soon plugin for WordPress to help successfully launch your site. Unlike many of the free plugins in the WordPress.org repository, I wanted to create a plugin designers, developers and users could depend on.</p>
