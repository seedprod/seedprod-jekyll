        <p class="uk-margin-top-remove"><i class="uk-icon-envelope"></i> I wanted to take a minute and say thank you for such a beautiful and easy-to-use product.  I announced my pre-launch the other day and my "coming soon" page made me feel really proud. Not only can I build my site in private, but I can create buzz and start directing people to it. And because of the full integration with MailChimp I've started building my subscriber list as well! I was hesitant to spend more money on my site before it's even live, but I have to say one week in and I'm already so happy that I did!</p>

        <p class="uk-margin-top-remove"><i class="uk-icon-envelope"></i> I never write reviews about a product but can I just say that I LOVE YOUR PRODUCT!! It works every time, it's so flexible and yet simple and it saves me so much time when I need to launch a site. I'm very glad I paid for this plugin and wanted to let you all know that your product is kind of amazing! Thanks.</p>

        <p class="uk-margin-top-remove"><i class="uk-icon-envelope"></i> I've been using the free version of this plugin for nearly 18 months, tonight I grab the pro version because my client needs a secret link to share, and WOW, i am truly blown away guys, great job, worth every penny to me. I rank this plugin up there with Advanced custom Fields and Askimet, absolutely essential. Keep up the great work!</p>
