"One of the very hard lessons we learnt in the past is that every business needs a coming soon page before the launch. Coming Soon page is a crucial component of having a successful website/product launch.  In the past creating a coming soon page required coding skills, but now with WordPress and SeedProd plugin, things have gotten a lot easier. So easy that a beginner can do it." <!-- via <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-create-beautiful-coming-soon-pages-in-wordpress-with-seedprod/" rel="nofollow"> wpbeginner.com</a>  -->

"SeedProd is a great way of building your email list before your website launches. It’s got great social media integration, is easy to use and very easy to style. The maintenance mode option is useful too if you need to switch your website off for 30 minutes or an hour to fix something on your site."
