I went searching the other night for a WordPress loop shortcode. I was surprised to find that there were none out there, so I made one. Use this shortcode below to create a loop on a page , post , or sidebar (with some tweaks). Insert in your functions.php or you can create a plugin for it. I have a plugin where I put all my shortcodes and that works quite well.
