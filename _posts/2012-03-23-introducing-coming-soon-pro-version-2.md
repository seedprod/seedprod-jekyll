I am excited to announce SeedProd’s [Coming Soon Pro Version 2][1]. After the initial launch of the Coming Soon Pro WordPress plugin back in September of 2011, I have received tons of positive feedback and feature request.

I started rebuilding the plugin at the 1st of the year and incorporated some of the features that had been suggested along with some ideas I had. Some of the new features include:

  * A reworked settings interface.
  * More control over the look and feel of the coming soon template.
  * A Maintenance Mode
  * More 3rd party Email Marketing provider integrations.
  * Gravity Forms Integrations
  * Import/Export Settings
  * Plus tons more…

Check out a complete list of [features][2]. If you currently own Version 1 of SeedProd Coming Soon Pro, be on the look out for an email this week on how to upgrade. Since this was a complete rewrite of the plugin some feature in Version 1 have been revamped in Version 2 and an auto upgrade could break your site.

Please feel free to leave any feedback in the comments.
