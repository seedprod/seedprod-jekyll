It's been about a month since I launched <a href="http://pagifyapp.com">Pagify</a> and I'm sort of in a rut. For some reason I've completely lost interest in my project.

I joined the <a href="http://www.micropreneur.com/">Micropreneur Academy</a> well after I started working on my product (80% complete to be exact) and like most other developers who have no Marketing knowledge I started coding before doing any research. I went though the academy learning the principles while still pushing forward building Pagify. As I learned the approach for launching a successful product and launch, I think deep down I began to realize that my product was not unique and was in a highly competitive space. Still I keep coding heads down. My launch came and went in April. Out of around 150 trials I had 3 sign ups. Since then none, and I haven't had any trial sign up in about 15 day even though ad words is bring about 8 uniques a day.

After launch I put on my Marketing hat which had not been worn up until that point and is the exact opposite this curriculum teaches. As I started doing my keyword research and looking over the competition I realized organic ranking would be extremely hard to achieve. Competition in the space is extremely competitive and filled with some VC backed company along with lots of free solutions. Needless to say the more I research and the more depressed I got.

Since launch I have been slacking. I have written a few blog post, bought some SEO links and doing research. I feel like I might be fighting a bull with a toothpick. Instead of adding features to my site I have been building a custom WordPress theme. Sort of the ultimate sales site theme. Basically a WordPress theme that does all the stuff the academy teaches you. Coming Soon Page, Tons of 3rd Party Integrations, MailChimp, Analytics, automatic creation of the killer sales site main pages. I plan to use this on Pagify to replace my current sales site and sell it as well. <a href="http://saastheme.com">http://saastheme.com</a>. I'm not sure if I'm building this site for Pagify or as a diversion to not work on Pagify directly.

I know the launch is just the start of the quest and building your business. I know I could probably pivot my product and focus on a niche, but I feel like I need to start back at the beginning and cut my loses.

I was thinking I could even turn my new Custom Theme into a product. I actually turned down a position with Woo Themes this summer to continue working on my product.

Anyway would love to hear your feedback positive or negative. I'm going to go get a beer.

Cheers
