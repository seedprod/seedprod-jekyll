Today I&#8217;m releasing my first WordPress plugin, WP YUI Menu. This plugin will allow you to easily add a [YUI Menu][1] to your WordPress theme.

[YUI][2] is Yahoo&#8217;s JavaScript library, and it&#8217;s an awesome one I must say. I have used it quite extensively and have been very impressed with it. In fact my site uses YUI&#8217;s Css Framework and theÂ  YUI Menu Plugin

[Get WP YUI Menu][3]!
