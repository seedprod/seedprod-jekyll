<p>Today I'm releasing my first Wordpress plugin, WP YUI Menu. This plugin will allow you to easily add a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/">YUI Menu</a> to your Wordpress theme.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a> is Yahoo's JavaScript library, and it's an awesome one I must say. I have used it quite extensively and have been very impressed with it. In fact my site uses YUI's Css Framework and theÂ  YUI Menu Plugin</p>
