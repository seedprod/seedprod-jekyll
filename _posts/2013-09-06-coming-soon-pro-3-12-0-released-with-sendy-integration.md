Coming Soon Pro 3.12.0 has been released and we are proud to announce Sendy integration. Never heard of [Sendy][2]? Sendy is self hosted newsletter software that allows you to send email newsletters 100x cheaper via Amazon SES. In fact it&#8217;s what I use to send SeedProd&#8217;s newsletters.

Check them out at [http://sendy.co][2]
