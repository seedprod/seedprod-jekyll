**Updated:** Back on WordPress as of 4/18/11

Posterous is a super easy way to post anything to the web. I&#8217;ve heard it described as a life streaming app, but I think it&#8217;s much more than that.

I signed up for Posterous back when it 1st came onto the scene. Back then it was most noted for the ability to post to multiple site like Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr, which was super cool but that&#8217;s about all it did.

I recently checked it out again a couple of weeks ago and noticed they had added tons of new features such as domain mapping, google analytics and feedburner integration, and the ability to create [custom themes][1]!

I have been a long time WordPress guru and I still am. The majority of my time is spent developing for WordPress and I even run a [site builder for Bands][2] using WordPress . But just because I&#8217;m a WordPress developer does not make me a hardcore blogger.  Developers usually spend more time coding than the do blogging. Which brings me to why I switched from WordPress to Posterous for my personal site.

I love how super easy it is to post to Posterous. I can open up gmail, attach some images, video, url, map, text or whatever and Posterous deals with it. Posterous will post it correctly and it will go out to my other sites. I can even tag from email. It handles [syntax highlighting][3]. They also have a [smart bookmarklet][4] that I can use to comment and post things from the Internet I find.

This is perfect for me because I usually don&#8217;t write long thought out post. They are usually done on the fly and less formal. And now with the theming feature I can customize the look and feel and even some of the functionality. As you can see on mine I using the [excerpt tag][5] which is listed as experimental. I&#8217;ve also hacked it a bit to created faux pages with the help of iframes and the {tagsascss} theme tag.

I have posted more in the last couple of weeks than I did the last 1 years using WordPress for [johndturner.com][6] and it&#8217;s sort of fun. Don&#8217;t get me wrong though, I think WordPress is definitely the leader in full featured blogging platforms, but as I said earlier I just don&#8217;t need all of that for my personal site. I also like fast and light weight nature of Posterous.

I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what Posterous will come out with next. They have been cranking through some feature request. I personally would like to see the ability to us JavaScript in themes and a sitemap.xml auto generated, but I&#8217;m sure what ever they do next will be cool.
