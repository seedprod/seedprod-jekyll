I&#8217;m proud to announce the latest version the [Coming Soon Pro][2] plugin for WordPress. I have been working on this new version for the past 5 months. The new version is highly extensible which allows for the creation of new 3rd party mail providers and pre made themes. There are also a laundry list of other improvements. See the changelog below.

One of our 1st mail provider add ons will be for MyMail and GetDrip.com available later this week. Many more to come.  We also will be releasing premium theme add ons. The plugin by default allows you to easily customize the look and feel. But we had many people who wanted pre-made themes to make it that much easier to get up and going. We&#8217;ll be releasing at least one new premium theme every week.

Version 4 is still in beta but should be exiting beta by the end of this week or early next week. You can download it from <a href="/members" target="_blank">your account </a>dashboard.

Upgrading from 3 to 4 will be an optional manual process. [Read more about the migration process][3].

I&#8217;d love to hear what you think about version 4. [Please give me your feedback][4]!
