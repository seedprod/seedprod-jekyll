<p>Creating multiple image sizes in WordPress is quite easy when the image is attached to a post or page. Theme.fm has an excellent <a href="http://theme.fm/2011/08/images-image-sizes-and-post-thumbnails-in-wordpress-1385/">write up</a> on how to do this with the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_image_size">add_image_size</a> function. The problem with this method is that it creates a lot of bloat because for every image uploaded it's sized to this new size even if you're not going to use it. Also getting the different available sizes from just a url is a pain.</p>

<p>To side step this issue Theme and Plugin developers have resorted to using scripts like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/timthumb/">TimThumb</a> , which recently have a <a href="http://blog.vaultpress.com/2011/08/02/vulnerability-found-in-timthumb/">major vulnerability</a> discovered. Another script that can generate images on the fly is called <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15311">vt_resized</a>. This script is nice because it uses native WordPress functions to generate the new image. The only is issue is that it does not support WordPress Multisite. Here's a modified version of the script with crude multisite support.</p>
<p>
If you find a bug let me know. Hopefully WordPress will provide a similar function in the WP core in the future.</p>
