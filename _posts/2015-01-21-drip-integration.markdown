SeedProd's Coming Soon Pro is proud to announce integration with [getDrip.com](http://www,getdrip.com). Drip is lightweight [email marketing automation](http://www,getdrip.com) made easy. From Drip's website:

"Maybe you’ve tried out one of the big players in marketing automation and you’re exhausted with their clunky UI or lack of new features.

Or maybe you’ve outgrown your entry-level email marketing tool and find yourself adding hack after hack to try to keep up with your marketing needs. At your stage, static email newsletters just aren’t cutting it anymore.

You've heard for years that marketing automation is a place to make big leaps in conversion rates; from lead nurturing to trial emails to post-purchase education and retention. But it's been too complicated and time consuming to set up.

If that's the case, you're going to love Drip."

SeedProd now makes it super easy to connect your Drip account.
