SeedProd turned 1-year-old this month and it would have actually gone uncelebrated but I was looking back through some old sales data and noticed the date.

I have learned a lot this year running SeedProd, like how to build a solid plugin in the wild world of WordPress, how to provide quality support and how to actually turn a profit which were all my goals when I started this venture coming off my nth failure which I wrote about [Startups – A brutally honest post and reality check][1]

SeedProd was an experiment as much as it was a business venture. I wanted to start small and focus on one product and make it the best on the market. I think I have achieved that. In that past year there have been many competitors to pop up and SeedProd is still the leader.

What&#8217;s next? SeedProd will continue to improve the [Coming Soon Pro][2] plugin and I have another plugin lined up for a late Fall release. Plus I plan to release some services I feel there is a need for in the WordPress market. I&#8217;m attending <a href="http://pressnomics.com/" target="_blank">Pressnomics</a> in November where I hope to meet a co-founder.

So cheers and here&#8217;s to another excellent year!
