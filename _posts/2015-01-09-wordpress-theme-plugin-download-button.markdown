I went searching for an official button for my free WordPress plugins similar to the [Google Play](https://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/promote/badges.html) and [Apple App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/#downloadOnAppstore) buttons. I was surprised to find nothing existed.
 This is my modest attempt to build one. Below is the Photoshop .psd and Web .png files.

 I would love to see [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org) build a tool similar to how [Google Play](https://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/promote/badges.html) generates their multilingual buttons. I may try to build one myself.

Anyone interested in a tool like this?
